# DiscordBot-ButlerJames -> Autoposting Memes from Subreddits


This bot posts random memes from selected subreddits at a selected interval.

You can select subreddits and add them to the bot. The bot will then post a random post from one of the subreddits at a selected interval per channel. 

You can copy the code and use it for your bot.
I know that automatically posting memebots cost money, so you could use my code and host the bot somewhere and use it for your server.
